#Note: If you want to use browser_mod with Home Assistant Cast, you need to also add:
#
#resources:
#  - url: /browser_mod.js
#    type: module
#to your ui_lovelace.yaml. 
#Don't worry about where to put browser_mod.js, the integration will handle that automatically, and please note that it's not /local/browser_mod.js.
